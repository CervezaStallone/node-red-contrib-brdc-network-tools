# node-red-contrib-network-tools

A comprehensive collection of network monitoring and discovery tools for Node-RED. This package provides four powerful nodes for network analysis, monitoring, and discovery in your Node-RED flows.

## Installation

Install directly from the Node-RED palette manager or via npm:

```bash
npm install node-red-contrib-network-tools

      { target: "8.8.8.8", alive: true, latency: 15 },
      { target: "1.1.1.1", alive: true, latency: 12 }
    ],
    aggregateStats: { averageLatency: 13.5, aliveTargets: 2 }
  }
}
```

## Configuration Tips

All nodes are organized under **"networktools"** in the Node-RED palette for easy access.

### Best Practices
- **Start small**: Begin with a single target before monitoring multiple hosts
- **Set reasonable timeouts**: Use 3-5 seconds for local networks, 10+ seconds for internet hosts
- **Monitor critical services**: Focus on essential infrastructure components
- **Use appropriate intervals**: 30-60 seconds for most monitoring scenarios

## Common Use Cases

### üè† Home Network Monitoring

```
192.168.1.1 (router)

## üéõÔ∏è Bonjour/mDNS Configuration

The Network Discovery node now supports **Bonjour/mDNS** (also known as zero-configuration networking) for discovering services that advertise themselves on the local network.

### What is Bonjour/mDNS?

Bonjour/mDNS enables automatic discovery of devices and services without requiring manual configuration. Common examples include:

- **Printers** advertising print services
- **Apple devices** (AirPlay, SSH, file sharing)
- **Web servers** on development machines
- **IoT devices** with web interfaces
- **Network-attached storage** (NAS) devices
- **Smart home devices**

### Configuration Options

**Enable Bonjour/mDNS Discovery:** Checkbox to enable service discovery

**Service Types:** Comma-separated list of services to discover:
- `http` - Web servers and web interfaces
- `ssh` - SSH servers
- `ftp` - FTP servers  
- `smb` - Windows file sharing
- `printer` - Network printers
- `airplay` - Apple AirPlay devices
- `afpovertcp` - Apple Filing Protocol
- `nfs` - Network File System

**Bonjour Timeout:** How long to wait for service responses (1000-30000ms)

### Example Service Types by Device

**Home Networks:**
```
http,ssh,printer,airplay,smb
```

**Development Networks:**
```
http,ssh,ftp,mongodb,redis,postgresql
```

**Office Networks:**
```
http,ssh,smb,printer,afpovertcp
```

### Benefits

1. **Discover .local hostnames** that don't exist in DNS
2. **Identify device types** based on advertised services  
3. **Find network services** automatically without port scanning
4. **Monitor service availability** in real-time
5. **Cross-platform compatibility** (works on Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Host unreachable" errors:**
- Check if the target IP/hostname is correct
- Verify network connectivity
- Increase timeout values for slow networks

**No devices found in network discovery:**
- Ensure the subnet notation is correct (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
- Check if devices respond to ping (some may have firewalls)
- Try smaller IP ranges first

**Bonjour/mDNS services not found:**
- Not all devices advertise services via Bonjour/mDNS
- Some networks may block multicast traffic (required for mDNS)
- Try increasing the Bonjour timeout value
- Check if devices are on the same network segment
- Some enterprise firewalls block mDNS traffic

**Bonjour discovery slow or incomplete:**
- Increase the timeout value (try 10000ms for large networks)
- Reduce the number of service types being searched
- Some devices may advertise services slowly after network changes

**Performance monitor not starting:**
- Verify at least one target is configured
- Check that targets are reachable
- Ensure monitoring interval is reasonable (minimum 10 seconds)
